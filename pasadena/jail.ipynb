    "The department provided the data in a [messy PDF format](data/raw/Restraint_Chair_Data.pdf). That limits this initial analysis in two ways: 1) some of the pages are scanned as images, rendering them flat (and impervious to PDF-to-text parsing software); and 2) the redactions in the PDF's narrative field make it impossible to extract in a machine readable format. We can talk about strategies for getting around this. It should also be noted that there are roughly 100 missing records because of the flat pages issue. Nevertheless, I was able to extract roughly 500 records from the PDF into a dataframe for analysis. "

Prisoner Gomez refused to stop and became belliegerent after being advised that jail staff would have to place him in a restraint chair for his own safety and to prevent damage to the facility. PSO Supervisor Adame attempted to deescalate the situation but the prisoner again stated that he would not calm down and wanted to be placed in to the restraint chair. Pso Burden, Pso Adame, and myself Pso Betancourt placed the prisoner in to the restraint chair with some resistance but no injuries to jail staff or the inmate. PSO Supervisor Burden was present on scene. [04/20/2021 05:50, LBETANCOURT, , PPD] \\nPA  "

I assisted Ofc Carter in getting the prisoner off the floor when the prisoner began pulling away from Ofc Carter. At this point Ofc Carter and my self placed the prisoner`s arms behind his back and requested the wrap system. We placed the prisoner in the wrap system with the help of PSO Walker and PSO Jalil. After being placed in cell 1708 Meehan began complaining of having high blood pressure problems, mental health problems such as bipolar disorder and being schizophrenic and then an hour and a half after being in the wrap the priosoner started to complain about having pains in his stomach due to a previous herina which he said he had already been having pains before coming to the jail. When i came back to the speak to the prisoner on a check shortly after the prisoner admitted that he just wanted to get out of jail and that he could sign a release for medical in order to get released. I explained to the prisoner that if he was seen by medical and needed to go to the hospital he would be released to go but would not be getting released to go home straight from the jail. When EMS did a vitals check on the prisoner they said everything looked normal and there was no need to worry especially about the blood pressure being too high. Meehan insisted in going because of pain in stomach due to the herina. Prisoner Meehan,Brandon was transported to the hospital and released from the jail with a rojo.

       "      <td>While PSO Clarke was about to take an inmate out of Cell 1733 , PSO Clarke heard a thump on the ground to which it sounded like someone was being restrained. I quickly closed the cell door and assisted Officer Slight with the inmate along with Officer Carter. The inmate had pulled away from Officer Slight when he was being brought into the booking area for a secondary search. PSO Betancourt left the booking office to get the restraint chair out of 1708. PSO Clarke,PSO Betancourt, and Officer Slight picked up the inmate and the inmate was properly restrained in the restraint chair. No issues or injuries occured during this incident of restraining the inmate. [04/03/2021 03:53, TPCLARKE, , PPD] \\nPAY</td>\n",

       "403  At approximately 2210 prisoner Meehan,Brandon Lee was placed in the wrap after refusing to stand up and come out \\nDOB\\nof the holding cell. The prisoner became belligerent while also using profanity and pulling away when arresting Ofc Carter attempted to talk to the prisoner and assist the prisoner off the floor. I assisted Ofc Carter in getting the prisoner off the floor when the prisoner began pulling away from Ofc Carter. At this point Ofc Carter and my self placed the prisoner`s arms behind his back and requested the wrap system. We placed the prisoner in the wrap system with the help of PSO Walker and PSO Jalil. After being placed in cell 1708 Meehan began complaining of having high blood pressure problems, mental health problems such as bipolar disorder and being schizophrenic and then an hour and a half after being in the wrap the priosoner started to complain about having pains in his stomach due to a previous herina which he said he had already been having pains before coming to the jail. When i came back to the speak to the prisoner on a check shortly after the prisoner admitted that he just wanted to get out of jail and that he could sign a release for medical in order to get released. I explained to the prisoner that if he was seen by medical and needed to go to the hospital he would be released to go but would not be getting released to go home straight from the jail. When EMS did a vitals check on the prisoner they said everything looked normal and there was no need to worry especially about the blood pressure being too high. Meehan insisted in going because of pain in stomach due to the herina. Prisoner Meehan,Brandon was transported to the hospital and released from the jail with a rojo.

Inmate then told jail staff if we took the handcuffs off to search him he would not co operate with jail staff orders and even attempt to fight jail staff. Officer Carter and myself attempted to reason with Mr. Jackson multiple times to co operate with our booking and searching procedures and to make his stay with us as easy as possible. Mr. Jackson continued to raise his voice at jail staff and promising that he would fight if he was removed from handcuffs. Jail staff then placed Mr. Jackson into the restraint chair with little resistance. No further conflict occurred. [11/11/2020 18:54, GGONZALEZ, , \\nPAY \\nPPD]   \n",

I quickly closed the cell door and assisted Officer Slight with the inmate along with Officer Carter. The inmate had pulled away from Officer Slight when he was being brought into the booking area for a secondary search. PSO Betancourt left the booking office to get the restraint chair out of 1708. PSO Clarke,PSO Betancourt, and Officer Slight picked up the inmate and the inmate was properly restrained in the restraint chair. No issues or injuries occured during this incident of restraining the inmate. [04/03/2021 03:53, TPCLARKE, , PPD] \\nPAY   \n",
