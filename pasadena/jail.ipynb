    "The department provided the data in a [messy PDF format](data/raw/Restraint_Chair_Data.pdf). That limits this initial analysis in two ways: 1) some of the pages are scanned as images, rendering them flat (and impervious to PDF-to-text parsing software); and 2) the redactions in the PDF's narrative field make it impossible to extract in a machine readable format. We can talk about strategies for getting around this. It should also be noted that there are roughly 100 missing records because of the flat pages issue. Nevertheless, I was able to extract roughly 500 records from the PDF into a dataframe for analysis. "
