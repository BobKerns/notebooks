While on duty and working as the Jailer, I was notified by PSO Teel and Officer Carter that the inmate had stripped off all of her clothes and was hitting the cell door to her cell. During this time I attempted to diffuse the situation by talking to the inmate via the jail intercom system. The inmate insisted on continuing her belligerent behavior and began telling me over the intercom that she would commit suicide if we did not go into the cell and stop her. PSO`s Teel, Herrera, and I then entered cell 1705 and escorted the inmate to restraint chair cell 1707. The inmate was placed in the restraint chair in cell 1707 without further incident or injury. PSO Supervisor Rhodes was notified and approved. It should be noted that prior to entering cell 1705 the inmate had put her clothing back on and was adequately dressed.

While working the jailer position I was notified via the jail radio that Officer Carter requested the jail staff to have the restraint chair in the sally port when he arrived. Upon arrival I observed the inmate to be violently hitting his head on the cage inside of the vehicle in what appeared to be a deliberate attempt to hurt himself. Officer Carter and I then ordered the inmate out of the vehicle at which point her refused, the inmate also refused to walk once assisted out of the vehicle. Due to the inmates self harming and erratic behavior, I made the decision to place the inmate in the restraint chair for his safety and the safety of the officers and jail staff. While attempting to put the inmate in the restraint chair, he actively resisted and would not listen to verbal commands given. Once fully secured in the restraint chair and wheeled to cell 1708 there were no further incidents or injury. Patrol Supervisor Sgt King was on scene and approved of the restraining of the inmate and PSO Supervisor Rhodes was notified and approved as well. It should be noted that the inmate is continually threatening jail staff and making derogatory sexual remarks towards jail staff. [07/03/2019 16:48, RTHOMAS, PA , PPD]",True

I responded to the sally port with the restraint chair and contact officer Carter. Officer Carter asked the inmate to exit the vehicle and then had to assist him out. Once out of the vehicle the inmate was placed in the restraint chair and began actively resisting and attempted to spit on officers and jail staff. Once fully secured in the restraint chair he was taken to restraint chair cell 1707 without further incident or injury. Later in the day the inmate was approaching his time limit in the restraint chair, the inmate began to curse at jail staff when asked basic questions about his behavior.
