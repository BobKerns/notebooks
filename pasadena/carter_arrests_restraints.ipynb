Upon arrival I observed the inmate to be violently hitting his head on the cage inside of the vehicle in what appeared to be a deliberate attempt to hurt himself. Officer Carter and I then ordered the inmate out of the vehicle at which point her refused, the inmate also refused to walk once assisted out of the vehicle. Due to the inmates self harming and erratic behavior, I made the decision to place the inmate in the restraint chair for his safety and the safety of the officers and jail staff.

       "      <td>At approximately 2210 prisoner Meehan,Brandon Lee DOB was placed in the wrap after refusing to stand up and come out of the holding cell. The prisoner became belligerent while also using profanity and pulling away when arresting Ofc Carter attempted to talk to the prisoner and assist the prisoner off the floor. I assisted Ofc Carter in getting the prisoner off the floor when the prisoner began pulling away from Ofc Carter. At this point Ofc Carter and my self placed the prisoner`s arms behind his back and requested the wrap system. We placed the prisoner in the wrap system with the help of PSO Walker and PSO Jalil. After being placed in cell 1708 Meehan began complaining of having high blood pressure problems, mental health problems such as bipolar disorder and being schizophrenic and then an hour and a half after being in the wrap the priosoner started to complain about having pains in his stomach due to a previous herina which he said he had already been having pains before coming to the jail. When i came back to the speak to the prisoner on a check shortly after the prisoner admitted that he just wanted to get out of jail and that he could sign a release for medical in order to get released. I explained to the prisoner that if he was seen by medical and needed to go to the hospital he would be released to go but would not be getting released to go home straight from the jail. When EMS did a vitals check on the prisoner they said everything looked normal and there was no need to worry especially about the blood pressure being too high. Meehan insisted in going because of pain in stomach due to the herina. Prisoner Meehan,Brandon was transported to the hospital and released from the jail with a rojo.

During the searching process inmate began to not follow directions given by officer Carter and myself. Inmate then told jail staff if we took the handcuffs off to search him he would not co operate with jail staff orders and even attempt to fight jail staff. Officer Carter and myself attempted to reason with Mr. Jackson multiple times to co operate with our booking and searching procedures and to make his stay with us as easy as possible. Mr. Jackson continued to raise his voice at jail staff and promising that he would fight if he was removed from handcuffs. Jail staff then placed Mr. Jackson into the restraint chair with little resistance. No further conflict occurred. [11/11/2020 18:54, GGONZALEZ, PAY , PPD]</td>\n",

The prisoner constantly used verbally assaultive language towards officers and jail staff. The prisoner was padded down and placed in the holding cage where he began to hit the cage and said he was going to give the jail staff hell. The prisoner was advised to calm down and to take a seat and wait to be proccesed, but began to jump on the bench. Immediately Ofc Carter and myself PSO Betancourt walked in to the holding cage and told the prisoner to place his hands behind his back. Right away we took control of the prisoner holding his arms behind his back and walked him to the restraint chair. The prisoner was strapped down to the chair by Ofc Carter, PSO Pina, PSO Betancourt, with the prisoner giving some resistance and placed into cell 1708 to be further observed. The prisoner continued to use abusive language and threaten staff as they passed by the cell. PSO Walls was present in the jail when the incident took place, and there was no injuries.

While on duty and working as the Jailer, I was notified by PSO Teel and Officer Carter that the inmate had stripped off all of her clothes and was hitting the cell door to her cell. During this time I attempted to diffuse the situation by talking to the inmate via the jail intercom system. The inmate insisted on continuing her belligerent behavior and began telling me over the intercom that she would commit suicide if we did not go into the cell and stop her. PSO`s Teel, Herrera, and I then entered cell 1705 and escorted the inmate to restraint chair cell 1707. The inmate was placed in the restraint chair in cell 1707 without further incident or injury. PSO Supervisor Rhodes was notified and approved. It should be noted that prior to entering cell 1705 the inmate had put her clothing back on and was adequately dressed.

While working the jailer position I was notified via the jail radio that Officer Carter requested the jail staff to have the restraint chair in the sally port when he arrived. Upon arrival I observed the inmate to be violently hitting his head on the cage inside of the vehicle in what appeared to be a deliberate attempt to hurt himself. Officer Carter and I then ordered the inmate out of the vehicle at which point her refused, the inmate also refused to walk once assisted out of the vehicle. Due to the inmates self harming and erratic behavior, I made the decision to place the inmate in the restraint chair for his safety and the safety of the officers and jail staff. While attempting to put the inmate in the restraint chair, he actively resisted and would not listen to verbal commands given. Once fully secured in the restraint chair and wheeled to cell 1708 there were no further incidents or injury. Patrol Supervisor Sgt King was on scene and approved of the restraining of the inmate and PSO Supervisor Rhodes was notified and approved as well. It should be noted that the inmate is continually threatening jail staff and making derogatory sexual remarks towards jail staff. [07/03/2019 16:48, RTHOMAS, PA , PPD]   \n",

While working the jailer position I was notified that a belligerent inmate was enroute to the jail and he was attempting to harm himself and making threats to fight officers. I responded to the sally port with the restraint chair and contact officer Carter. Officer Carter asked the inmate to exit the vehicle and then had to assist him out. Once out of the vehicle the inmate was placed in the restraint chair and began actively resisting and attempted to spit on officers and jail staff. Once fully secured in the restraint chair he was taken to restraint chair cell 1707 without further incident or injury. Later in the day the inmate was approaching his time limit in the restraint chair, the inmate began to curse at jail staff when asked basic questions about his behavior. Furthermore the inmate threatened to assault jail staff and officers and began rocking the restraint chair in a violent manner in an attempt to flip it to harm himself. Patrol Sgt Lebedzinski was notified shortly after the inmate was placed in the restraint chair, and approved of the chairing event. [12/29/2019 20:48, RTHOMAS, PA , PPD]   \n",
       "7   At approximately 2210 prisoner Meehan,Brandon Lee DOB was placed in the wrap after refusing to stand up and come out of the holding cell. The prisoner became belligerent while also using profanity and pulling away when arresting Ofc Carter attempted to talk to the prisoner and assist the prisoner off the floor. I assisted Ofc Carter in getting the prisoner off the floor when the prisoner began pulling away from Ofc Carter. At this point Ofc Carter and my self placed the prisoner`s arms behind his back and requested the wrap system. We placed the prisoner in the wrap system with the help of PSO Walker and PSO Jalil. After being placed in cell 1708 Meehan began complaining of having high blood pressure problems, mental health problems such as bipolar disorder and being schizophrenic and then an hour and a half after being in the wrap the priosoner started to complain about having pains in his stomach due to a previous herina which he said he had already been having pains before coming to the jail. When i came back to the speak to the prisoner on a check shortly after the prisoner admitted that he just wanted to get out of jail and that he could sign a release for medical in order to get released. I explained to the prisoner that if he was seen by medical and needed to go to the hospital he would be released to go but would not be getting released to go home straight from the jail. When EMS did a vitals check on the prisoner they said everything looked normal and there was no need to worry especially about the blood pressure being too high. Meehan insisted in going because of pain in stomach due to the herina. Prisoner Meehan,Brandon was transported to the hospital and released from the jail with a rojo.

Carter. During the searching process inmate began to not follow directions given by officer Carter and myself. Inmate then told jail staff if we took the handcuffs off to search him he would not co operate with jail staff orders and even attempt to fight jail staff. Officer Carter and myself attempted to reason with Mr. Jackson multiple times to co operate with our booking and searching procedures and to make his stay with us as easy as possible. Mr. Jackson continued to raise his voice at jail staff and promising that he would fight if he was removed from handcuffs. Jail staff then placed Mr. Jackson into the restraint chair with little resistance. No further conflict occurred. [11/11/2020 18:54, GGONZALEZ, PAY , PPD]   \n",
